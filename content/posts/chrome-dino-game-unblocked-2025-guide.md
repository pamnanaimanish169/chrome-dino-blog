## ‚ùìWhy Chrome Dino is blocked in some places

While this game is addictive and truly entertaining it can sometime be distracting and unproductive, here are top 3 reasons why Chrome Dino game is blocked in some places:

- **Distraction and Unproductiveness**: While the easeness of playing and quick accessibility are some of the great strengths of the games, it also serves as it‚Äôs weakness since you can play it for hours without realising it. This however can hamper your productivity at work and cause you your job.

- **Policy-Based Network Restrictions**: Although you may not consider the game harming, your network administrator might not think the same. So, it might be your network administrator that has been sitting on that gruesome desk and blocking your access to the only game that you have been playing.

- **Preventing Game Modding or Hacking**: Modifying the game beyond its original capabilities might make it a little less fun to play. Keeping the originality while enjoying the game is something that keeps the game intact and interesting. So, if you find the game to be blocked, preventing it from modding or hacking might be one of the reasons.

- **Abuse of Offline Mode**: Some users might deliberately plug off the game to play this game on the offline mode (but you can play it without going offline [here](https://dinogamerunner.in)), it can hamper the work progress or the assignment you were supposed to be submitting yesterday.
