Let's be honest here â€“ you were given a serious task with a tight deadline to work on but instead you are here reading this blog about the Dino game of [Google](https://dinogamerunner.in/). 

No worries, we all have been there and done that. The **Dino Game of Google** is like that only, too simple to become addicted without realising. It was developed under the name ["Project Bolan"](https://blog.dinogamerunner.in/posts/play-dinosaur-game-on-chromebook-2025-edition/) by some engineers at Google.


## What is the Dino Game of Google and why did Google create it?

**Dinosaur game** (also known as **Dino Game of Google**) is a browser game developed and maintained by the tech giant Google. Played in the Chrome Web browser, in this game you have to guide a pixelated t-rex (also known as lonely t-rex) across a side-scrolling, desert landscape. The game was created by Sebastien Gabriel, Alan Bettes, and Edward Jung in 2014.

The game was developed as an Easter egg with the Chrome browser to entertain users when their internet connection is lost.

## From Chrome Tabs to Phone Screens: The Dino's Got Range

The original **Dino Game of Google** was available only offline once you have lost your internet connection. While the offline version still thrives, the game has expanded its turf to new age devices like smartphones and tablets.

You can play the **Dino Game of Google** at following places:

- **Offline on Google Chrome**: The PH game is available on ` chrome:dino ` or you can try loading any page when your internet is disconnected.
- **On Android Chrome**: Lost signal on your smartphone while exploring that dense forest? Worry not, the game shows instantly as soon as you try to open theChrome browser.
- **Online Anytime**: Yup it's a thing. You can play your favourite **Dino Game of Google** at dinogamerunner.in and other fan sites without waiting for your WiFi to quit.

In short: the Dino's evolved. He's not just your emergency entertainment anymore â€” he's a full-blown time killer with cross-platform ambitions.

## Bonus Stage: Chrome's Dino Isn't as Simple as He Looks

Think the game's just jump-and-run? Think again. Hit 700 points and you'll unlock a night mode â€” the background flips from bright desert sun to moody moonlight. It's a subtle touch, but it adds just enough pressure to throw off your cactus-jumping rhythm. Welcome to Dino: After Dark.

Think the game's just got a fancy old jump-and-run? Think again. When you hit 700 points you are thrown into the wilderness of Dark Mode where your dino cruises through obstacles like cacti and [pterosaurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterosaur). 

Also, if you are a normal person (with dark mode enabled on your system) the **Dino Game of Google** will start off in the dark mode itself and switch back to normal after 700 points. That being said may God be with you while you navigate through the nuances of the game while maintaining your cool ðŸ˜‰.

## Final Jump

The **Dino Game of Google** started as a simple offline joke â€” and ended up becoming everyone's favorite way to procrastinate. Whether you're dodging cacti during a network outage or just "taking a break," this little T-Rex never disappoints.
