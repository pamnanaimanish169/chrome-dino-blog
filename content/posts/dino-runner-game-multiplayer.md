## Tips to Beat Your Friendsâ€™ High Score (and brag about it ðŸ˜‰)

Letâ€™s be honest, you have shared the link with your friend and started playing with each other. Your friend was a newbie so you taught him/her to play the game and after a few days he has already started beating you. You feel cheated and probably want to beat him/her to take your revenge. Worry no more, youâ€™ve come to the right place. In this section we will teach you some tips to potentially beat your wannabe new friend.

- **Warm Up in Solo Mode** - Before going to the real face-off with your friend practice a little bit in Solo Mode here. Try to synchronise the long and short jump while trying to predict the obstacle by looking ahead

- **Donâ€™t look at the Dino (Seriously)** - While some may argue that focusing on the Dino too much may increase your focus, in reality itâ€™s the opposite. While focusing on the Dino may increase your hand-eye coordination you can easily miss the obstacle ahead of you once the speed increases. So try to focus slightly ahead of you (like 2 seconds ahead) while keeping your fingers on the spacebar.

- **Tap, Donâ€™t slam**: While keeping your finger on the spacebar and pressing is hard is one thing and might work for someone, but it doesnâ€™t work for everybody. Try to gently tap the spacebar as you just have to avoid the obstacle and not fly high into the air. So next time you have the urge to slam that spacebar key in frustration, do it here in Solo mode first before your final face-off with your friends.
