## A Game That Only Shows Up When Your Internet Gives Up

You know that moment – when you are trying to load something important and right at that point of time the browser freezes. You are just about to call the internet provider in frustration and just before that a pixelated dino appears on the screen waiting for your attention.

Out of curiosity you hit that space button and voila you enter the adventurous world of the **Dinosaur game by Google** where your only task is to avoid cacti and [pterosaurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterosaur) while waiting for your internet connection to restore.

## What in the pixel is **Dinosaur Game by Google**?

Launched in 2014 as an [Easter Egg by Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_Game) [The Dinosaur Game by Google](https://dinogamerunner.in/) appeared on your browser when your internet started behaving like stone age. The goal of this game is to navigate your Dino (also known as lonely t-rex) through different obstacles like cacti and pterosaurs until and unless your internet behaves fine and dandy.

It was created by engineers Sebastien Gabriel, Alan Bettes and Edward Jung as a way to engage users until the internet was restored back. Little did they know they were unleashing a procrastination giant.

## No Wi-Fi? Here's a Dino to distract you

The Game initially codenamed [“Project Bolan”](https://blog.dinogamerunner.in/posts/play-dinosaur-game-on-chromebook-2025-edition/) – designed to keep you sane while your router took a break is quite simple to play. Here are some ways to play the game online/offline while having the luxury of coffee at your side:

- **Offline Mode**: Although the game appears automatically when the internet goes down, you can manually play the game by typing ` chrome://dino ` in the Chrome Internet Browser.
- **Controls**: Tap the spacebar (or the arrow up button) while you are on the Desktop. On the mobile screen just tap on the Dino to make it jump and avoid obstacles like a pro.
- **Online version**: Yup, it exists and it's pretty dandy too. You can play the Online version of **Dinosaur Game by Google** [here](https://dinogamerunner.in/) without waiting for your internet to go down.
